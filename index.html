        <p>This is currently my blog for future research for iOS, macOS, UEFI, and many more platforms. It also a host to my MobileSubstrate tweaks that are also available on Cydia and other software projects on github</p>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I am a student at TAMU in College Station, Texas. I know C, C++, Objective C, Swift, Java, x86/ARM ASM and even some ACPI Machine Language. I have been interested with iOS/macOS and UEFI/BIOS software development since high school and am now going to document my research for people to readily be able to learn. Email me at ilhan.raja@icloud.com if you have any questions. Here is a link to my <a href="https://github.com/YungRaj/YungRaj.github.io/raw/master/_site/Resume.pdf"> Resume</a><p>
        <h4>StreakNotify</h4>
        <span style="color:orange;">01-10-2017</span>
        <p>I recented talked to CokePokes about the recent changes within Snapchat with regards to DRM, and concluded that the best solution for allowing compatability with Phantom is to include my code within the Phantom project. I will remain the maintainer of my code, however I will be collaborating with CokePokes to update StreakNotify/Phantom to combat Snapchat's DRM. BUT, if you only want to install StreakNotify alone, you can since it by itself does not activate Snapchat's DRM. To install my tweak through BigBoss on Cydia, use this link <a href="http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.yungraj.streaknotify/"> link</a> I will still be pushing updates to this tweak for the newest versions and doing the best I can to add more features/fix bugs. If you have any questions, you can email me.</p>
        
        <h4>First post</h4>
        <p>Thank you so much for taking a look at my blog. As I do research I will document my findings about the Objective C/Swift Runtime under the hood, XNU/Darwin, EFI/UEFI, and news in the jailbreak/security community and OSX86. Stay tuned. If you feel inclined to contribute, please let me know and I'll be more than willing to accept help.</p>
