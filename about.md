This is currently my blog for future research for iOS, macOS, UEFI, and many more platforms. It also a host to my MobileSubstrate tweaks that are also available on Cydia and other software projects on github

I am a student at TAMU in College Station, Texas. I know C, C++, Objective C, Swift, Java, x86/ARM ASM and even some ACPI Machine Language. I have been interested with iOS/macOS and UEFI/BIOS software development since high school and am now going to document my research for people to readily be able to learn. Email me at ilhan.raja@icloud.com if you have any questions. Here is a link to my [Resume](https://github.com/YungRaj/YungRaj.github.io/raw/master/Resume.pdf).
